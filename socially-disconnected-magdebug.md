### Socially Disconnected in Germay

Its been a year and a couple of months since I came here to Germany on April, 2022. Over this period, i lacked creating social relationships with the Germans for a couple of reasons:
* Remote work: I work remotely, from the apartment, which I spend 8 hours a day at least
* Language barrier: In order to connect with people, it is more easy and intuitive to speak with German, thant to ask first if the person knows hows to speak English
* Germans are less social than us


* What is the main problem? 
	- Technical Problem
	- Management Problem
	- Sales/Marketting Problem
	- Logistics Problem
	
	
	* Trying a test payment
	* google ads is stopped
	* facebook ads is stopped
