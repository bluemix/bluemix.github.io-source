### Cinemana Leanback (Android TV)


##### Android TV was at its beginning, and starting with it on this project step-by-step was a major improvments to my Android skills. I've learned what lean means, and how the design for TV should be. I've [learned RxJava](https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/application_development/9781784399108), because I realized, after watching a [Netflix video on Rx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAZJsxcykPs&t=802s) that kind of such coding must be elegant, reactive and less coding to be written. I _thought_, that why whould RxJava to be made by Netflix unless there was a serious demand on it. It was the first application that I used Retrofit and Paper in it. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

##### Main development features
#### Kotlin and Java
#### My first RxJava usage, [Paper](https://github.com/pilgr/Paper), [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), and _lots_ of others

### Cinemana STB

##### This was my first project on an STB at the company back to June 2015. It was planned to be finished after a week! üòÄ, and lasts for about 5 months in development. The main reason, was that the company were unsure and have vague vision of what this project would actually do. So, up on their unstable and unsure submitted needs, I spent the time learning more and more about Android and how deal with JSON, RESTful APIs, how to exploit GitHub libraries that ease development, how to customize views and how to use text fonts for appropriate UI position, i.e., primary and secondary texts, light, normal and bold weight; how to use localizations and dark and light app thems. I also learned a lot about UI/UX from my fellows (specefically, our department manager [Huthaifa](http://huthaifa-abd.com) and our director at that time [Ali Usam Al Cherchefchi](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=687503386&ref=br_rs)). They were really kind and give every help you might wanted for. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

### CBox Launcher (Android TV)

##### It is a complement for Cinemana STB, since there must be a launcher that shows company internal apps at the launcher home screen. It was re-implemented three times, with each iteration having a complete different UI. The third iteration moved the app to Android TV to work with Cinemana Leanback, as shown in the screenshots. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

### eCortex
##### My first-ever Android app for university graduation project. Start the camara , touch on an English word and Arabic translation is show as a pop-up! It used OpenCV to segment the image and separate shapes to be passed to Tesseract (learned lots from [Gaut.am](http://gaut.am/making-an-ocr-android-app-using-tesseract/)). I was having a SQLite vocabularies (taken from online xlsx file) in order to translate the segmented, parsed English word. It was really _a thing_ to me back in 2012.


### eBook Broswer
  ##### A .NET Windows desktop application built using C# and WPF and SQLServer (co-work with my friend) that shows a list of local PDFs as a list so that the user can select the book easily on a single place.
