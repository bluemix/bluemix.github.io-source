# Talabatey: August 2021 - March 2022

Working with [Talabatey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Smart+Delivery+Group&hl=en) was enjoyable as there are always interesting tasks to solve. It was also my return to mobile apps development since 2020 (2 and half years apart). I started to using Jetpack Compose instantly in Android, because it is declarative (like Flutter and SwiftUI). I'll list below the apps I worked on, what I did with each generally.

## Medresty (Android <sup>[Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medresty.medrestyapp&hl=en)</sup>)

This app is about providing school students with online materials (i.e., E-Schools). I was responsible for re-designing the app UI using Jetpack Compose, and a few other features.

## Drivers (Android <sup>[Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talabateydriver)</sup>)

This app is used by drivers who deliver food ordered from [Talabatey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talabatey) app. I was responsible to continue development on this app, where I started to use Jetpack Compose for the first time in it. I didn't completely refactor the app, but rather incorporated Jetpack Compose into it. In addition to this, I was also responsible about a number of UI/UX enhancements, and make the app more easier to use.

## Partners

This app is used by restaurants to manage their orders (e.g., when a user orders from [Talabatey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talabatey) app. I've built this app from scratch using Flutter. I was also the one responsible for its UI/UX.

# Freelancing: June 2017 - September 2017

## Online سوق (Android, iOS)

An e-commerce app that allows government employees to shop by instalments and order them at the specified date and time. Unfortunately, this project didn't see the light (being on production), because the project stopped later in the development.

## Cinemana Leanback (Android TV)
Android TV was at its beginning, and starting with it on this project step-by-step was a major improvements to my Android skills. I've learned what lean means, and how the design for TV should be. I've [learned RxJava](https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/application_development/9781784399108), because I realized, after watching a [Netflix video on Rx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAZJsxcykPs&t=802s) that kind of such coding must be elegant, reactive and less coding to be written. I _thought_, that why would RxJava to be made by Netflix unless there was a serious demand on it. It was the first application that I used Retrofit and Paper in it. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

### Main development features
#### Kotlin and Java
#### My first RxJava usage, [Paper](https://github.com/pilgr/Paper), [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), and _lots_ of others

## Cinemana STB 

This was my first project on an STB at the company back to June 2015. It was planned to be finished after a week! 😀, and lasts for about 5 months in development. The main reason, was that the company were unsure and have vague vision of what this project would actually do. So, up on their unstable and unsure submitted needs, I spent the time learning more and more about Android and how deal with JSON, RESTful APIs, how to exploit GitHub libraries that ease development, how to customize views and how to use text fonts for appropriate UI position, i.e., primary and secondary texts, light, normal and bold weight; how to use localizations and dark and light app themes. I also learned a lot about UI/UX from my fellows (specifically, our department manager [Huthaifa](http://huthaifa-abd.com) and our director at that time [Ali Usam Al Cherchefchi](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=687503386&ref=br_rs)). They were really kind and give every help you might wanted for. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

## CBox Launcher (Android TV)
It is a complement for Cinemana STB, since there must be a launcher that shows company internal apps at the launcher home screen. It was re-implemented three times, with each iteration having a complete different UI. The third iteration moved the app to Android TV to work with Cinemana Leanback, as shown in the screenshots. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

# Undergraduate project: 2012

## eCortex <sup> [Slides](/images/projects/eCortex_presentation.pdf)</sup>

My first-ever Android app was for our university graduation project. Start the camera , touch on an English word and Arabic translation is shown as a pop-up! It used OpenCV to segment the image and separate shapes to be passed to Tesseract (learned lots from [Gaut.am](http://gaut.am/making-an-ocr-android-app-using-tesseract/)). I was having a SQLite vocabularies (taken from online xlsx file) in order to translate the segmented, parsed English word. It was really _a thing_ to me back in 2012. It was a collaboration with my other colleague.

<br>

## eBook Browser
  ##### A .NET Windows desktop application built using C# and WPF and SQLServer (co-work with my friend) that shows a list of local PDFs as a list so that the user can select the book easily on a single place. . It was a collaboration with my other colleague, where he was responsible for the database management, and I was responsible for UI design.
