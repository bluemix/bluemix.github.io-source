# Talabatey: August 2021 - March 2022

Working with [Talabatey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Smart+Delivery+Group&hl=en) was enjoyable as there are always interesting tasks to solve. It was also my return to mobile apps development since 2020 (2 and half years apart). I started to using Jetpack Compose instantly in Android, because it is declarative (like Flutter and SwiftUI). I'll list below the apps I worked on, what I did with each generally.

## Medresty (Android <sup>[Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medresty.medrestyapp&hl=en)</sup>)

This app is about providing school students with online materials (i.e., E-Schools). I was responsible for re-designing the app UI using Jetpack Compose, and a few other features.

## Drivers (Android <sup>[Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talabateydriver)</sup>)

This app is used by drivers who deliver food ordered from [Talabatey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talabatey) app. I was responsible to continue development on this app, where I started to use Jetpack Compose for the first time in it. I didn't completely refactor the app, but rather incorporated Jetpack Compose into it. In addition to this, I was also responsible about a number of UI/UX enhancements, and make the app more easier to use.

## Partners

This app is used by restaurants to manage their orders (e.g., when a user orders from [Talabatey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talabatey) app. I've built this app from scratch using Flutter. I was also the one responsible for its UI/UX.

# Tatweer: January 2018 - May 2019

## Hyundai GK-Auto (Android <sup>[Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatweer.hyundai)</sup>)

GK-Auto is an official Hyundai partner in Iraq, and developing a specific app for their company was a challenging task. Gk-Auto mobile app has very good user experience and satisfaction, it it was my first app to be deployed on Google Play using Flutter.

## E-Menu
An electronic foods menu for browsing foods and dishes for the restaurant to be used by customers on tablets (iPads) instead of the regular paper-based menus. It was built using native Android, and distributed to the restaurant tablets (without using Google Play store).

# Some Open Source Mobile Projects

Below are a couple of projects that I published on GitHub, and they're all built using Flutter.


## <div><span style="float: left">Tourism Demo App</span><span style="float: right; margin-top: 4px">{% raw %}<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/bluemix/tourism-demo" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star bluemix/tourism-demo on GitHub">Star</a><script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>{% endraw %}</span></div>
<br><br>

It was Eid Al-Fitr (after Ramadan), and I wanted to build cutting-edge, beautiful, and fast. I wanted to build the best I can do with Flutter and then publishing it on GitHub. 

<br>

<img src="/2018-a-year-to-remember/tourism/flutter-tourism-demo-400x300.gif" width="100%" alt="tourism-demo-flutter" loading="lazy" />

<video width="100%" controls>
    <source src="/2018-a-year-to-remember/tourism/tourism-app-demo-4_2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>


<br><br>	

I've published the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/bluemix/flutter-tourism-demo), and i hope people will like it more. It uses Redux, shows animations, internationalization (i18n), ClipPath, and fonts, among others. I focused on how to switch between Arabic and English in the app using Redux. It was really important for me, especially, I was really proud of it showing it in the Flutter time in Google I/O Extended - Baghdad.



## <div><span style="float: left">Gradient Screens </span><span style="float: right; margin-top: 4px">{% raw %}<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/bluemix/Gradient-Screens" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star bluemix/Gradient-Screens on GitHub">Star</a><script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>{% endraw %}</span></div>
<br><br>

Inspired by gradients from AlTameerHR app, I said why not creating pages contains gradients, whether buttons, cards, or texts. So, I started designing those screens with the intent of publishing them on GitHub. Some of the screens were my designs, other taken from other UI designers. Below are the repo and its screenshots.

<br>


{% img /2018-a-year-to-remember/gradient-screens/gradient_screen_arabic_text_flutter.png 195 Gradients Screen with Arabic text in Flutter %}
{% img /2018-a-year-to-remember/gradient-screens/intro_page.png 195 Gradients Screen with English text in Flutter %}

{% img /2018-a-year-to-remember/gradient-screens/be_kind_page.png 195 Gradients Screens in Flutter %}
<br>


## <div><span style="float: left">Gradient Widgets</span><span style="float: right; margin-top: 4px">{% raw %}<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/bluemix/gradient-widgets" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star bluemix/gradient-widgets on GitHub">Star</a><script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>{% endraw %}</span></div>
<br><br>

The idea incepted from gradient-screens, by turning gradient widgets into a Dart package and publishing it on GitHub.

{% img /2018-a-year-to-remember/gradient-widgets/gradient-widgets-flutter.png 260 Gradient Widgets in Flutter %}

Gradient progress was the longest one to develop. 

<center>
{% img /2018-a-year-to-remember/gradient-widgets/gradient_widgets_progress_demo.gif 400 Gradient Widgets in Flutter %}
</center>

I learned, I can publish the project when the main features are finished, and then continue enhancements later, otherwise, _I will never_ publish a project. 
Those days where really hard and amazing 🙏🏼. 


# Freelancing: June 2017 - September 2017

## Online سوق (Android, iOS)

An e-commerce app that allows government employees to shop by instalments and order them at the specified date and time. Unfortunately, this project didn't see the light (being on production), because the project stopped later in the development.

# Earthlink Telecommunications: April 2015 - June 2017

You can't imagine how I adore and remember my fellows and friends at this company. It was one of the top places that I ever worked and lived in my life (I was living at the company for two years). All of those projects wouldn't incept without their support, friendship, and kindness. They were the best.

## Cinemana Leanback (Android TV)
Android TV was at its beginning, and starting with it on this project step-by-step was a major improvements to my Android skills. I've learned what lean means, and how the design for TV should be. I've [learned RxJava](https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/application_development/9781784399108), because I realized, after watching a [Netflix video on Rx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAZJsxcykPs&t=802s) that kind of such coding must be elegant, reactive and less coding to be written. I _thought_, that why would RxJava to be made by Netflix unless there was a serious demand on it. It was the first application that I used Retrofit and Paper in it. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

### Main development features
#### Kotlin and Java
#### My first RxJava usage, [Paper](https://github.com/pilgr/Paper), [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), and _lots_ of others

## Cinemana STB 

This was my first project on an STB at the company back to June 2015. It was planned to be finished after a week! 😀, and lasts for about 5 months in development. The main reason, was that the company were unsure and have vague vision of what this project would actually do. So, up on their unstable and unsure submitted needs, I spent the time learning more and more about Android and how deal with JSON, RESTful APIs, how to exploit GitHub libraries that ease development, how to customize views and how to use text fonts for appropriate UI position, i.e., primary and secondary texts, light, normal and bold weight; how to use localizations and dark and light app themes. I also learned a lot about UI/UX from my fellows (specifically, our department manager [Huthaifa](http://huthaifa-abd.com) and our director at that time [Ali Usam Al Cherchefchi](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=687503386&ref=br_rs)). They were really kind and give every help you might wanted for. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

## CBox Launcher (Android TV)
It is a complement for Cinemana STB, since there must be a launcher that shows company internal apps at the launcher home screen. It was re-implemented three times, with each iteration having a complete different UI. The third iteration moved the app to Android TV to work with Cinemana Leanback, as shown in the screenshots. _Earthlink subscribers only_.

# Undergraduate project: 2012

## eCortex <sup> [Slides](/images/projects/eCortex_presentation.pdf)</sup>

My first-ever Android app was for our university graduation project. Start the camera , touch on an English word and Arabic translation is shown as a pop-up! It used OpenCV to segment the image and separate shapes to be passed to Tesseract (learned lots from [Gaut.am](http://gaut.am/making-an-ocr-android-app-using-tesseract/)). I was having a SQLite vocabularies (taken from online xlsx file) in order to translate the segmented, parsed English word. It was really _a thing_ to me back in 2012. It was a collaboration with my other colleague.

<br>

{% img /images/projects/eCortex-project-overview.png  eCortex: our university graduation project %}



## eBook Browser
  ##### A .NET Windows desktop application built using C# and WPF and SQLServer (co-work with my friend) that shows a list of local PDFs as a list so that the user can select the book easily on a single place. . It was a collaboration with my other colleague, where he was responsible for the database management, and I was responsible for UI design.
