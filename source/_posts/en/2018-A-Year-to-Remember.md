When I look 12 months back, I see Odoo, Flutter and Turkey. In this 2018 review, I'll talk of each technology I worked with, instead of categorizing it to the months I faced with.

I'll call it Odoo and Flutter year.


## Odoo


### CakeHR
### Flask
### Docker
### JSON-RPC
### XLSX Reports
### Email Summary Reports

## Flutter
### How I got hooked
You can not imagine how much I am proponent against cross-platform mobile frameworks, like ReactNative, Xamarin, Cordova or PhoneGap. Luckily, I have a friend ([Mustafa](https://www.facebook.com/mustafa1024m)) whoes always suggets cutteing-edge technologies to try with. So one day (in March or April, 2018) he told me to try [Flutter](https://www.flutter.io), and I (between me and my self) refused and was against this or any cross-platform technologly. But, one day, while I was working part-time with @Tatweer, one of our clients (GK Auto, a Hyundai agent in Iraq) wanted high-quality app for both Android and iOS, and within a month or less ðŸ¤”.
So, the  challenge was to how do it within this time-frame. And, I don't want to to repeat the two-brains-ache for developing for Android in Kotlin and iOS with Swift. I wanted to see practical and _beautiful_ solution. I tried ReactNative before, and was not at all satisfied with its UI and programming with JavaScript and the bridge thing. 
So, I remembered my friend tip: Try Flutter!. I installed the [Flutter Gallery Example](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.flutter.demo.gallery), and I was fascinated by its smoothness and UI composition, and most importantly, how it handles RTL at best. The challenge began in May 2018, by learing Flutter and developing our client app within a month. Keep in mind, that I was working full-time (08:00-16:00) at Al-Tameer and working on Flutter at part-time (any four hours after 16:00, after my full-time).

### GK Auto - Hyundai

It is not the first time I build a mobile app, and learing Flutter the first time was (for me) not a completely new exprience. 
It is the same concepts with Android and iOS, but now, with different language (Dart) and different component names. The learing curve was fast.
I built some prototypes to learn Flutter before starting with the Hyundai app. After about two weeks of consistent and hard working with Flutter, 
I got used with the framework and its philosophy. <br>


Next, are the screenshots and _videoshots_ of different phases during building my first production-level flutter app. The application is avaiable on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatweer.hyundai) (on AppStore, our client still keeping it on the _pending_ state).

One of the early reasons convinced me to adopt Flutter was its handling of Arabic langauge (RTL) at best. As you can see from the shots above, the app is in Arabic and it was the first requirement our client talked on.

The deadline of the project was a month, but, the development continues for three months. All of the design and ideas of the app was proposed by us. Our client wanted an app that represents their identity about vehicles they show and sell. Every detail, and every single step in the app was througtly discussed everyday, between me, and the back-end developer, Abdulla, and our product manager Sadoon.

One thing to mention and not to forget about, is that, the work on this app was the toughest for me this year (2018). It was Ramadan (Our muslim's fasting month), and I remember I was staying awake the whole month till 04:00 at dawn, and then waking up to my work at 07:15, and luckily, our full-time reduced to 14:00 at this month. The routine continues even days after Ramadan, and I still have the urge to stay up late to do my next Flutter project: A Tourism Demo App.

<br><br>

It was Eid Al-Fitr (after Ramadan), and I wanted to build cutting-edge, beautiful, and fast. I wanted to build the best I can do with Flutter and then publishing it on GitHub.

I've publihed the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/bluemix/flutter-tourism-demo), and i hope people will like it more. It uses Redux, shows animations, internationalization (i18n), ClipPath, and fonts, among others. I focused on how to switch between Arabic and English in the app using Redux. It was really important for me, especially, I was really proud of it showing it in the Flutter time in Google I/O Extended - Baghdad.



### Google I/O 2018 Extended, Baghdad - Flutter

Probably, one of the best developers events happened in 2018 (July 13th) was this, Google I/O 2018 Extended in Baghdad, hosted by [d3 Studio](https://d3stud.io/) at [The Station](https://www.facebook.com/thestationiq/). It featured cutting-edge technologies, and luckily (and honored), I was the [speaker](https://www.facebook.com/GDGBaghdad/photos/a.129742190962410/250301902239771) about Flutter.

I was kinda new to this framework, only two months early being working on it, heavily. I couldn't talk about the Hyundai project (it was a private project), and the only thing to show to them was the [Tourism Demo](https://github.com/bluemix/flutter-tourism-demo), which shows the capabilities Flutter is in terms of animations and i18n, among many other things. 
The challenge for me was how to show to the audience the difference between Flutter and ReactNative, and how Flutter has better app quality in terms of UI composition, smooth animations, and how Dart is compiled natively instead of using a JS bridge in ReactNative. Talk slides are [here](https://www.slideshare.net/AbdElmomenKadhim/google-io-2018-extended-baghdad-flutter). It was really a _thing_ for me, because it shows that we are up-to-date to current technologies and our region is not living in a separate world, and to encourage programmers here to rely and start developing cross-platform apps using Flutter, and most importantly, is to push technological advancements at our area.



### AlTameerHR App

Up to that time, I was developing in Flutter without using specific architecture, which led the Hyundai app to become a mess for me, because as the app grows, lots of Widgets will be built and you'll lose focus of where part are you working now. 

Before I started my next production-level project, I needed to understand an architecture before jumping to code Flutter. [inKino](https://github.com/roughike/inKino) was my saviour. I spent more than a week understanding the code and playing with it. The code was neat, well-thought, and beautiful. It used [Redux](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_redux) for its architecture.

It is the first time I develop an app inspired by gradients and curved backgrounds. The challenge was how to create a beautiful HR application, but the problem was all I have was text-based data, e.g., check-ins and check-outs, attendance summary, leave requests, etc... and the only image avaiable was the employee avatar picture. So, in order to add colors and shapes to the app, gradient buttons and gradient background is added, to contain the dullnes of text-only data. 
The app is avaiable on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.al_tameer.altameerhr), but still in the pending state for iOS, because, kind of such apps developed specifically for employees requires an enterprise license, instead of publishing it to the AppStore (I wanted to upload it to the AppStore, but failed in the review process, insisting this type of apps be outside of the app store).

### <div><span style="float: left">Gradient Screens </span><span style="float: right; margin-top: 4px">{% raw %}<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/bluemix/Gradient-Screens" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star bluemix/Gradient-Screens on GitHub">Star</a><script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>{% endraw %}</span></div>
<br><br>

Inspired by gradients from AlTameerHR app, I said why not creating pages contains gradients, whether buttons, cards, or texts. So, I started designing those screens with the intent of publishing them on GitHub. Some of the screens were my designs, other taken from other UI designers. Below are the repo and its screenshots.

<br><br>

The idea incepted from gradient-screens, by turning gradient widgets into a Dart package and publishing it on GitHub.

## BilWeekend to Sulaimaniay


After finishing _Strike a Pose_ screen at 02:00 AM, I should start going at 03:00 AM to the bus, where a trip to Sulaymaniyah for four days was waiting us (me and my sister and my little sister) with [BilWeekend](https://www.facebook.com/BilWeekend/posts/2260915274143666). It was the first time I go with my little sister on a trip. The trip includes hiking, camping and vising Ahmed Awa's waterfalls. It was really enjoying exprience. I was cpturing photos using my Nikon D750, and 35mm f/1.4 Sigma ART lense only. Sure, I took lots of photos, and I two of them got featured on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/@bluemix).

<br>

One of the suprises in the trip, is that, one of my iOS developer friends, was also going with us, [Husam](https://www.facebook.com/husamaamer.9), and a popular (or public-figure) photographer in Baghdad, [Ali DabDab](https://www.facebook.com/ALI.DAB.DAB11).

It was not the first time I go to Sulaymaniyah. This is my second time, and the first was on April 2018 with BilWeekend too, but was alone, and was cold, and I was shooting with 85mm Sigma ART lense. The following pictures (post) are taken from both of the trips. I hope you like them ðŸ™‚.

## Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·


Istanbul was not just a city for me. It is a mix of different cultures and rife history, reflects to me how Turkey is a civilization, and we're (Iraq) behind them by at least 30 or 40 years, and I believe, it is not only better in terms of quality of life, but, the people's mindset is modern than us. I admire their civil infrastructure, e.g., the roads, road sides, etc..., are built with care and very good finishing.
The people were kind, helpful and felt like it is a very good place to live. This level of advancements can't be achieved without honest, hard work to develop their country and their mindset.


Nikon D750, with 35mm Sigma ART was my companion. The whole 7 days (except for one night), I was shooting whenever I go, in cloudy, light or heavy rain, day and night. All of my best shots were published on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/@bluemix). I also post some of them on Facebook. They were my my favorite shots till the time of this writing. Istanbul is beautiful, it is just like designed to be gorgeos from every angle you take picture. It was filled with details.

<br>

My trip to Turkey, feeled like it is one of the check points in my life. I learned a lot from this country.
I've used Uber and Google Maps, which really helped me to discover tourism attraction places, especially, Galata Tower (it was not on the trip places to visit list). The first time I use a _powerbank_, because, half the day I was with our guide to show us places, and the other half was free time, where I was disovering new places. The last two days I got really tired from walking long distances with my camera, and you the feeling to return home, althought, new places are always coming to you, and 7 days are not enought to explore Istanbul.
