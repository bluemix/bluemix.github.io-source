## Brief History


The farthest memory I remeber about recognizing typefaces (fonts) is distinguishing between Arial and Tahoma, and then I was never using the default typeface for any software I use, especially Arial. As you can see below, none of them have Arial. 

This is some of the screenshots of videos I made during my teenage (during 2005, 2006 and 2007). 

<br>

{% img /images/about-type/abdulmomen-video-screenshot-pre-2007-5.png 250 My name (AbdElmomen, عبدالمؤمن) on some home-made videos before 2007 %}

<br>

At that time, and even before 2005, [Yahoo! Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Messenger) and [Camfrog](https://www.camfrog.com/), had also an effect in making me realize and took care of my written chat text color, size, and font, and trying to use something with different scheme from other ones. I remember I installed some application that allowd me to use custom text color instead of the the predefined, fixed, list of colors from Camfrog.

One time I installed a custom font (from CDs), and used it on my Camfrom chat settings. After very long time, I discovered, that this font only works on my own PC, and it is fall-backed to the default app font on others. I remember, I reached a state where I couldn't separate between system fonts,and user-installed fonts. I figured it out later, when I was going to some Internet coffees, and check what are the default typefaces that I can use, that will work for me and for others.

Then, I stated to notice the typefaces used in movies or series subtitles, on TV or when played on my PC/Laptop. 

<br>

<br>

When I watched videos with subtitles, the defacto-standard at that time (before 2010s) was VLC (because it supports Arabic subtitles encoding, specifically, ISO 8859-6 or Windows-1256) and spending most of the time changing typefaces, till I get setteled on one (and most I don't settle -- settle on *none*). The last time I remeber I adored subtitles typeface was [Palatino Sans Arabic](https://www.linotype.com/712147/palatino-sans-arabic-family.html), before the era of Cinemana.

<br>


From 2012-2014, I was master degree student, [my thesis](http://bluemix2.blogspot.com/p/my-thesis.html) was written using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and I remember, I was using a better version of Times New Roman (I don't remember the typeface name exactly). During the assesment and evaluation of my thesis, the session's supervisor asked me if I am using a different typeface that is not Arial or Times New Roman, and I answered I am using Times New Roman. I lied, and felt bad about it in its time. Days later, our department manager noted me about the font (I don't remember the exact words of him), but it was a note about my thesis font. Sometimes I wonder if is one of the reasons my degree was not excellent (it was very good). Anyways.

<br>


There is something that I need to confess: In [My old blog](http://bluemix2.blogspot.com/), i was having an article written in 2014, lists some of Arabic Linotype fonts, and lots of them were designed by Nadine Chahine!. It was the most viewed article on the blog. It is archived since 2017. Apologies to Nadine (and I hope my apologies be accepted 🙏🏼).

*Purchasing* [Amariya](https://catalog.monotype.com/family/monotype/amariya), my first Arabic typface I bought for my personal blog, designed by [Nadine Chahine](http://arabictype.com/). After that, I moved to my own blog (this), to have a custom typface installed on it, as you can see in the reasons why I moved from blogger.com (I don't know whether blogger.com supports custom typefaces or now, but, it was _one_ of the reasons to use a custom typeface).

<br>

{% img /images/about-type/moving-from-blogspot.png 480 one of the reasons to move from Blogspot is to have a custom typeface on my blog %}

<br>

While surfing the Web, I found a project on DeviantArt, called [BahijVirtualAcademy](https://www.deviantart.com/bahijvirtualacademy), that have high-qulity Arabic fonts, and they were 99% the exact of previously used (hacked) typefaces. I was, and still using them. It turns out, the author, has little modified the original fonts, and then released them as Bahij+*OriginalFontName*. 
For example, I was using TheSans typeface, and now it is BahijTheSans, and Koufiya to BahijKoufiya (Koufiya is a typeface designed by Nadine Chahine). 

If you compare the original font and BahijX, you'll get 1% visual difference between them. In the future, I tend to stop using them. They're copycats.

* my first and real try was with Cinemana, beautifully typographed, whe using the light, bold and normal weights of Helvetical Neue Arabic typeface
* Hyundai GK-Auto, was using GE SS Two, by which I fell in love with it. I was capturing it whenever I saw it in my day. 
* Purchasing GE SS Two, which doesn't support English :/
* At that time, TheSans, was one of the best UI typefaces I ever used. It is crisp-clear, compact but not narrow, elegant and different weights avaiable. It was using the pirated version. Except for AlTameerHR, which uses Bahij TheSans, I don't use TheSans Arabic today in apps I design and develop. I feel guilt when using it, and to be honest, it is outdated for me.
* 

* my favorite typeface library on Android was [Calligraphy](https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy), that changes the typeface for the whole app, for iOS, I was relying on a static file for labels
* on Flutter, it is very easy, to set the typeface for the entire app, and no library is needed
* I adore ffShamel Family typeface, they're beautifly designed, professionally-crafted, and gorgeous.



## Hunting GE SS Two


* took me couple of days, from supermarkets, to shops, to my room stuff, ads, etc...
* the collection was very easy, since GE SS Two was popular and common in everyday life things.

## Arabic Typography Course

* the main reason I wanted to learn type design was to publish as many free and open-source typefaces, and to enrich the poorness (lack) of Arabic typefaces in the area
* other reasons: I wanted more, high-quality, typefaces, other than, TheSans, Helvetica Nue Arabic.
* I discoved ffShamel Family

* I spent more than a week reading Nadine Chahine's Ph.D. thesis related to typeface legibility
* just because i know and doing good with calligraphy, it doesn't mean I'll learn and master type design faster
* it was ramadan, and some of the sessions was starting at 19:00, that happened to be the breakfasting time.
* type design is the art of details
* the missing connection between us (collegeaus)
* how I underestimate typography
* times moves faster than software development (type design > coding > design)
* 'beatiful group of letters' quote
* one session was enough for me to have the pleasure seeing and communicating online with Nadine Chahine
* buying Glyphs ($300) and this course (850 €), was one of the biggest things on software I spent
* i miss the energy that comes from session meetings
* was it enought? absouletely
* cooperative and delightful attitude by Nadine during the whole 10 sessions
* fareness by taking time to enhance (edit) our typefaces we were working on them
* professionals are cursed with OCD :D (the first time I noticed her enhancing a curve was taking very long time for her, the first time it was out of her control, and was immersed in it, until she realized it will take too long for her to get fixed or until she get satisfied, and most times, not satisfied, and continue digging deep with curves)
* is it everyhing I wanted to learn? it is, and more.
* do I encourage about entering future online arabic typography classes with Nadine Chahine? absouletely.


It all starts when I saw a tweet of [Nadine Chahine](https://twitter.com/arabictype):
{% twitter https://twitter.com/arabictype/status/1067091493725327365 %}

and I was very eager to reply to the tweet, and then start enrolling the course, no matter when it will starts, for how long, or what it costs.


The first session was in the mid of April, 2019.
