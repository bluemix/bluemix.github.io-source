I was using [Ktor](http://ktor.io) for about a month and I have created a personal project, and I wanted to be deployed on a [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com) droplet, that has Fedora 26 installed. Here are the basic steps I've collected in order to deploy your Ktor server running.

First of all, let's install some required packages.

### Pre-requesities

#### **wget, unzip, zip**
  `$ sudo dnf install wget unzip zip`

#### **[SDKMAN!](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli)**
  `$ curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash`

  then, this must be run at your user directory, e.g., at `/home/<USERNANE>/` path:
  `$ source "/home/<USERNANE>/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"`
  
    

### Java and Kotlin

After SDKMAN! has been installed, you should now install Java and Kotlin
`$ sdk install java`
`$ sdk install kotlin`

### Running Ktor...

Now, locate your Ktor project,

`$ cd your-ktor-project/`

You might want to have the Gradle script be executable,
`$ chmod +x gradlew`

then, run the Gradle script,

`$ ./gradlew run`

* You might get _**Caught an exception trying to connect to Kotlin Daemon**_, by which solved through running the above command again ðŸ¤”

Your server should be running now!
