Over the past week, I've been writing most of the Odoo customizations I did since 2017 in a single webpage (article). I've included my work in companies and my freelance work too. 

I've reached to a point that I must show my work to others so that they know what I have worked on in Odoo. It is a good milestone in my blog/website.
