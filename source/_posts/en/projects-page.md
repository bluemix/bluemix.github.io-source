I am really happy to creat a list of projects I've done in the past years, specifically from 2010 till now. I spent the whole yesterday working on it. I was lucky to have screenshots of most projects. I also concluded that, after each new release, there must be screenshots recorded in order to save the history of the app chronology. You can see the list here http://bluemix.me/projects. <br><br>


Most of my major projects was at [Earthlink Telecommuncations](http://earthlinktele.com) company, where great stuff was built. I am really proud of them. I see the projects as only the beginnings of professionalism in building mobile apps. I hope to build a useful library or software that users can benefit from it. I hope to leverage or push the software of best practices here locally; and at the same time, to learn and apply what creative developers world wide create and shape the software industry. As being said: [Think globally, act locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_globally,_act_locally).<br><br>


One of the main prjects that I'd like to create is an Arabic programming language for kids to learn programming at schools. Imagine, you can programin an Android app using a simple Arabic programming language! a language that has DSL like Kotlin, so you can build UIs using DSL. You know, just a thought :)
