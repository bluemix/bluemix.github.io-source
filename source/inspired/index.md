### Behdad Esfahbod
![Behdad_Esfahbod](/images/Behdad_Esfahbod.jpg)

"My name is Behdad. It's roughly pronounced as [beh da:d] [es f@h bo:d] in IPA ASCII transcription. It is a Persian name, natively written as بهداد اسفهبد. I was born and grew up in Iran, and moved to Canada in 2003. These days, I travel between California, Canada, and the rest of the world. I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google, leading the fonts and text rendering team. Previously I worked at Red Hat's desktop team.

I am a huge Free Software enthusiast, and previously worked on the GNOME Project. My long-term goal since late last century has been to make Persian work great in computer software, in particular, in Free Software, though these days my focus is not limited to Persian anymore."
