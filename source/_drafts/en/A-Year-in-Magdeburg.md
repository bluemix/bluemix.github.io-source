### Before Germany

In 2019, I was working with a company in Baghdad, and living closely to it (less than 20 minutes by public transportation to reach the company).
At the end of 2019, My family moved to Baghdad in a rented apartment, and before that they were in Al-Hillah (ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸêŸÑŸëŸéÿ©) (Babylon), Jebalah (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑÿ©) (or Kuthah). A couple of months later, Covid-19 hit the world, and we have to stay and work from home. 
On February 2020, i quit my work, and moved my stuff with my family. I didn't work for a company till August 2021 (a year and a half worked either for side projects or freelancing), where afterwards I joined Talabatey. I continued working from our new home, in Al-Tajiyat (ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ¨Ÿäÿßÿ™), Baghdad.

Later on December 2021, a friend and collegie of mine reached me if I want to work in Germany (because I've been indulged to work, and at the same time was learning Japanese to plan for a scholarship on April next year) i said no for the offer. Days and weeks passed and i was re-thinking about it again and again, with the new challenges or opportunities, the language or the culture or the quality of life. It was very hard for me to imagine that I'll ever work outboard, for a lot of reasons, mainly i should serve my own country first than others. My friend approached me again and told me that a couple of our friends will go to Germany! i was suprised and happy at the same time, because i took it as an opportunity to add exprience to my life, alongside with joyment and friendship. So, i accepted it, and my mind started to exprience what it will be like to live there. I got distracted a lot from my main work, thinking about Germany, seeing YouTube videos about the city that I'll go (Magdeburg), or learning about the German culture in general. 

<br>

At these weeks, I felt very nervous and was mostly thinking about my life in Germany.
After the job interview in mid-February 2022, I submitted my papers to the German Embassy in Baghdad at the beginning of March. Once again, stress and distractions overwhelmed my mind, as I worried that some mistakes might happen or something I was unaware of might occur. It was negatively impacting my working productivity with Talabatey.

Then, I received the work visa to start working in Germany one week later. I was very happy, and was a big relief for me, as now at least I know exactly what to do and how to plan for the upcoming months.


## Onboarding

Countdown starts that I have to say goodbye to my family, where me and them couldn't believe that I am going to Germany tonight! I was preparing my stuff on Friday, the day that I'll leave at night, so everything was to be fast and taking as necessary things as possible. 
Me and two of my friends and colleges were travelling to Germany to start working for the same company. The flight was at 3'Oclock AM and we should arrive to Berlin at 12:10 PM, and then we have about 3 hours to reach Magdeburg from Berlin Brandenburg Airport, so a total of about 18 hours of travel from our home in Baghdad to our friend's apartment in Magdeburg. You can imagine how long and tiring it is.

When crossed the security check at the Berlin airport, we were very happy and congratulated each other about it. Then, one of our friends who was working in Magdeburg came to pick us from the airport to Magdeburg. The first time I saw Berlin main station, i was amazed by its engineering, and get more amazed when I was on the train, and how stable and calm it is. 

 When we arrived (29.03.2023), our friends in Magdeburg helped us buy beds and other stuff that might be necessary in the upcomming days of staying at the apartment. I remember seeing very few young people at our neighborhood, and only old people in the streets, which led me to conclude that _Germany_ will extinct in the next 10 years üòÑ. The first week were cloudy and cold, and rainy, and even some ice felt. I am a type of person who likes being at hot climate than with cold, and when I exprienced the first week, i said I didn't come to live in this cold weather!
 I started working my first day at the company, were I received my laptop (Apple MacBook Pro Max 2021) and mouse and keyboard and a bag, and the first week i was working at the office. Later weeks, i was also working from the apartment, which was uncomfortable, because I was working from my bed, with the laptop small screen.

### Apartment Search

The problem that my visa to enter Germany was only valid for three months, and during that period, I _must_ apply for the Blue Card, which requires registartion for tax id, health insurance and apartment. The latter was a frustration and was the most stressful and dissappointed for my onboarding. Over the period of _two months_, i was searching relentlessly for an apartment, and with no results at atll. Either they reject our application, or don't reply to us at all. These dissapointments, one after the other, also effects my energy to work, and the day I got rejection, it meas my whole day is ruined. 

They always told me that they don't have apartments, either reserved for Ukranian families or not available anymore or don't reply at all; so I tried to email them, and they responded with an appointment, and once they know I don't know German, they said they're sorry, they don't have apartments anymore. Maybe they're right, since I was only have job contract and the visa, and without Schufa or residency card (because it was my first time arriving to Germany). _Luckily_ üôèüèº, the relocation support collegue at our new company got back to work from her parental leave. She contacted one of our apartment companies by mail, and a couple of days later they replied to her and we got the confirmation that we (me and one of my friend) will get the apartment in the upcomming days. It was a big relief for me, and at least i can plan onwards on what to do for the upcomming months; because if my visa gets expired, and i didn't get my address, then i _must_ leave Germany, and go back to Iraq.

Two weeks remaining till my visa gets expired, I mailed Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde (foreigns office) about my condition, and was (yet) unable to find any apartment.

> I submitted my documents to the Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde (foreigns office) for my Blue Card before my visa gets expired by two weeks, but didn't receive a reply from them. Then, me and our relocation support collegue went to their office before my visa gets expired in a couple of days, and once they know about this, they gave us a fictional visa that is valid for another 6 months till we arrange our selves in the city. I received my Blue Card in August (two months after my submission to my documnets in June). 

## Exploring Magdeburg and around

I am a kind of person who likes greens vegetation, and once I setteled in the apartment, now, its time to explore Magdeburg and around it. 

### Berlin
### Leipzig
### Hamburg


## Settelment


## At the time of writing

It has being more than a year (12 + 4 months) when I started working remotely here in Magdeburg. 90% of my time is at my room, working usually from 09:00 till 17:00 or 18:00. Lunch or quick shopping in between. When I look back to the beginning of April 2022, where I started working in Germany, till the current day, _isolation_ triggers my emotions and memory. I am socially isolated from being connecting to other, different, diverse people. [The winners of remote work](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/upshot/remote-work.html) _must_ have their costs. The _work-life balance_ is at its best: at work, no one calls you after 17:00 or if you're on vacation (at least for me), and it is the first time in my job doing the things _in the right, correct way_ (not the fast, breakable way, as was done in Iraq); and after work, i have to give my mind a rest, preparing dinner and sometimes checking my social media, at least getting updated (passively). The same repeats the next day. I live in a shared apartment with a friend and a collegue, and in case we met at the apartment, we might discuss some topic. But, that is not enough for me (and even for him) to know about the culture and society of the German people. I am a social person, i like to engage in conversations with different topics about life with different people from different backgrounds. This _feature_ is missing here in Germany, at least for me being in Magdeburg. But, i succedded in mitigating this isolation to a satisfiable degree (described later in this article).

When I walk in the streets where I can see German people, I passed silently, unnoticed and unaware of my existence to them. When I see German people in the streets, they walk with  heads up, eyes focused, determined face expression and oblibion, unaware of my existence to them. I _really_ passed silently to them, which makes me more islated and sad about this suitation.
