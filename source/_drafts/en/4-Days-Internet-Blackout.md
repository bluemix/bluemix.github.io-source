The good:
* social media apps (Instagra, Facebook) where stealing our time
* sober
* in one day (Thursday), I did a work that would be done in one week (Darine typeface)
* distraction, addiction
* we are owned by social media apps
* 

The bad:
* no reliance on Iraqi government when related to the Internet
* anti-trust for establishing a business that relies on the Internet in Iraq
