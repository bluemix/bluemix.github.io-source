> The 4 days blackout continued to be about a month!

The good:
* social media apps (Instagram and Facebook) where stealing our time
* sober (not thinking of what to post or making any decision
	 for how people interact with something)
* in one day (Thursday), I did a work that would be done in one week (Darine typeface)
* distraction and addiction
* we are owned by social media apps
* taking lots of walks with my friend Saif, because, it is lonely, and dark when there is no Internet

The bad:
* no reliance on Iraqi government when related to the Internet
* anti-trust for establishing a business that relies on the Internet in Iraq

There is a tendency to live outside of Iraq; at least they appreciate the bless of the 
Internet and don't cut it to the entire people for any general or specific reason.


## Guilty or No Guilty

Over the past three weeks, I was watching short clips for the TV series _House M.D._ on YouTube.
I watched more than 10 clips, and got the feeling to watch the full episodes of it.
But, there was a problem. It was not available on Google Play Movies, nor on Netflix, or on Wavo (from OSN).
I couldn't watch it on Fox online, because it requires me a US back account or credit card issued from the US.
I can buy it from Amazon as a DVD, but this is really impractical way to do it (I don't have a DVD player, first, and requires at least three weeks
be shipped to Iraq).
The last option, was, on Cinemana. I watched lots (about 10 episodes) of House on it. It was fast, has Arabic subtitles and different resolutions to select from (up to 1080p).
